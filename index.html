    <h3>How to Find a Rescue/Shelter</h3>
<p>There are shelters and rescues all over the world. Start in your local town or region by visiting a shleter. Many have websites with animals looking for a home. The website will give you information about how to contact or inquire. From personal experience, I have found some shelters request you make an appointment and complete a survey about the pet you hope to adopt. </p> 
<p>You can find breed specific rescues. Use the breed and rescue as your search terms - ex. <strong>"golden retriever" rescue</strong> and you will find a list of resources. Do your homework about the rescue groups.  Many rescues are run by volunteers who have full time jobs. Find out how the pets are cared for while waiting for adoption. Are they fostered in homes? Does the group adopt out of state? Are home checks involved? My experience with rescue groups is that they want the pets to be good match with you. Sometimes the pet whose picture you fall in love with isn't the right pet for your lifestyle. </p>

        <p>
            My name is Nicole. I created this website because we've adopted all of our dogs from rescue groups. They've been wonderful companions full of love. Many of my friends and family have also adopted their pets or worked with rescue groups to give these animals a second chance at life. Thank you to everyone who works in rescue. Your efforts are truly appreciated.

            <h3>About this Website</h3>
            <p>
                This website highlights only a small number of resucue groups. All the animals in the pictures were adopted/rescued/fostered by my friends and family. I live in the USA so most of the resources are based in my country. Another SheCoder created a <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/cohorts/shecodes-basics-add-on-133ce0f8-95f9-4153-9f71-3c0f4ced110a/projects/1980220">website about volunteering with animal shelters. </a> The international links are from her site. She created a wonderful website. Please click the link to view it.
